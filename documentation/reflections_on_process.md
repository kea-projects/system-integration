# Reflections on process

This document should contain the following:

"This is used in the exam report. Write down your general observations during the semester."

## Project requirements

The project requirements file had to go through multiple revisions before it was clear what has to be done.
Some of the requirements were too vague or were missing some information, slowing down the initial process
of planning the system and how it should integrate with the partner group

## Project Timeline and the sense of urgency

It wasn't clear what the scope of the project is and how much work actually has to be done until quite late into the semester.
This may have caused some groups to not plan properly on when to finish parts of the system, start integrating with the partner group etc.

## Lack of deeper understanding of certain topics

Due to the structure of the lectures, important topics were often discussed very briefly, providing a very shallow
understanding of the pattern/technology behind them. This has been especially impactful in how we design the system,
where a lot of knowledge was simply not showcased before the designing period, or was not deep enough to provide
a good enough understanding of the topic for every team member to comprehend the requirements.
